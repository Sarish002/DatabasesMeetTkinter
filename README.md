# DatabasesMeetTkinter
This is a Simple GUI Code that uses TTKbootstrap and SQLite3. But, there are a few limits.

No.1 --> Import PIL(Python Imaging Library) and TTKbootstrap(Version of Tkinter) before running. 

No.2 --> Once you have added, found, deleted or updated you can't do any other action other than repeating what you did.

No.3 --> Run the InitCode.py File to create the database before running main.py

I have had only 1 month of experience in Python. So please don't judge! :D
