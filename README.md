# DatabasesMeetTkinter
This is a Simple GUI Code that uses TTKbootstrap and SQLite3. But, there are a few limits.

Firstly, import PIL(Python Imaging Library) and TTKbootstrap(Version of Tkinter) before running. And secondly, once you have added, found, deleted or updated you can't do another action other than repeating what you did.

I have had only 1 month of experience in Python. So please don't judge! :D
